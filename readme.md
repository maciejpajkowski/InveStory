# Roadmap

- ~~Build a basic UI for the app (header, sidebar, trade options)~~ DONE!
- ~~Improve the UI to be more aesthetically pleasing~~ DONE!
- ~~Implement basic functionality for selling and buying products~~ DONE!
- ~~Implement slightly more advanced functionality for selling and buying products~~ DONE!
- ~~Implement functionality of automatic stock and price updates~~ DONE!
- ~~MVP status~~ ACHIEVED!

**The game in its very basic state (as Minimal Viable Product) is ready, however there are a few features more to be implemented:**

- ~~Improve buy/sell buttons to make them disabled once a condition is met (not enough money to buy something or nothing to be sold)~~ DONE!
- ~~Refactor the code to optimize the workflow~~ TURNS OUT IT'S FINE! (I guess)
- Add slightly more products on the market
- Add more UX features such as more CSS animations to make the experience more interesting
- Add app routing to be able to switch between Trading and Investing ("Stats" will most likely be ignored for now, but not forgotten)
- ~~Allow the player to choose how much of the product do they want to buy/sell~~ DONE!
- Add a timer on sidebar to show how much until next stock & prices updates
- Add the ability to invest

Once all of the above is done, the project will be considered finished.
